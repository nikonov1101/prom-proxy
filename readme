prom-proxy
=========

The simpliest possible http proxy. Must be deployed at the network edge, 
and forward scrapper's request inside the network.

Then, configure you scrapper to get metrics from a single node,
but different URLs (note that target is the same):

- job_name: "service-1"
  metrics_path: "/metrics_1"
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - "prom-proxy:5001"

- job_name: "service-2"
  metrics_path: "/metrics_2"
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - "prom-proxy:5001"
